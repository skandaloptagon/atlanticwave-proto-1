    lc_container/
In this directory, build the container with the following command
  docker build -t lc_container .
This is create a docker container that can be used to run the 
Local Controller. example-awave-three-site.sh has details on how to
run the container.
To update the AtlanticWave/SDX code, the container must be rebuilt. 
Unfortunately, means rebuilding from scratch:
  docker build --no-cache -t lc_container .


    sdx_container/
In this directory, build the container with the following command
  docker build -t sdx_container .
This is create a docker container that can be used to run the 
SDX Controller. example-awave-three-site.sh has details on how to
run the container.
To update the AtlanticWave/SDX code, the container must be rebuilt. 
Unfortunately, means rebuilding from scratch:
  docker build --no-cache -t sdx_container .


    nettest/
This is a helper container that can be used to create containers
to peform pings and iperfs. Used in conjunction with pipework
(https://github.com/jpetazzo/pipework), it make life a lot easier. See 
https://github.com/jpetazzo/pipework#connect-a-container-to-a-local-physical-interface
for details. Further, using the 8021q driver, one can create VLANs
easily. See example-nettest-setup.sh for more details.
This container can be built form the directory with:
  docker build -t nettest .


    example-awave-three-site.sh
This is an example of how to run three local controllers and a 
single SDX controller. 


    example-nettest-setup.sh
This is an example of how to create VLANs on physical interfaces,
and assign them to containers using pipework.
